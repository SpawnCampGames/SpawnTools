## Spawn Audio  v1
Spawn Audio is a collection of (3) scripts that simplify the process of creating an audio system in your project.
With one button click this tool will create all the GameObjects, AudioSources, and Scripts
needed to have a working system as soon as you Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

It works by creating a singleton, `SpawnDJ`, that contains a list of Methods for manipulating
the AudioSources just created. To play audio you just pass in a clip.

To call any of these functions or to play audio just call `SpawnDJ.Instance.SomeFunction();` 
from anywhere in your project.


### üìÑ SpawnAudio.cs
---
*Main script, and responsible for creating the GameObjects, AudioSources, and `SpawnDJ`*

#### _Channels_

This is the number of AudioSources that will be created to play AudioClips.
The more sources the less likely you'll have to create an additional AudioSource.

#### _Sfx / Background Volume_

The default values for the AudioSources to be created.


### üìÑ SpawnDJ.cs
---
*The singleton that's created by SpawnAudio.cs. Allows you to call basic functions to control the audiosources*

**This Component sits alongside the SpawnAudio Component but is Hidden in the Hierarchy**



Call a function from the SpawnDJ class from anywhere in your project with:

`SpawnDJ.Instance.Function();`
