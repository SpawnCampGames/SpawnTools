## Spawn Audio
---
Spawn Audio is a collection of (3) scripts that simplify the process of creating a audio system in your project.
With one button click this tool will create all the GameObjects, AudioSources, and Scripts
needed to have a working system as soon as you Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

It works by creating a singleton, `SpawnDJ`, that contains a list of Methods for manipulating
the AudioSources just created. To play audio you just pass in a clip.

To call any of these functions or to play audio just call `SpawnDJ.Instance.SomeFunction();` 
from anywhere in your project.

### üìÑ SpawnAudio.cs
---
*A script to create the audio manager, audiosources, and setup the hierarchy, all inside the editor.*

- Drag and drop background audio clips into the script.
- Assign how many audiosources you want available for the script to manage. [Channels]
- After sources are created an Instance of SpawnDJ is created.

### üìÑ SpawnDJ.cs
---
*The singleton that's created by SpawnAudio.cs. Allows you to call basic functions to control the audiosources*
**This Component sits alongside the SpawnAudio Component but is Hidden in the Hierarchy**



Call a function from the SpawnDJ class from anywhere in your project with:

`SpawnDJ.Instance.Function();`
